- Add built in benchmarking for parsing. Likely as option on command line execution
- Get rid of nightly requirement due to current benchmarking code
- Add c library interface for use from python
- Improve datfile test cases
- Get basic op2 parsing working for practical purposes
  - Probably expose iterator for all data types rather than try to map the data
